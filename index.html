                <h4><b>Geography</b></h4>
                <p>Italy (Italian: Italia [iˈtaːlja], officially the Italian Republic (Italian: Repubblica
                    Italiana [reˈpubblika itaˈljaːna]),is a European country consisting of a peninsula delimited by
                    the Alps and surrounded by several islands. Italy is located in south-central Europe, and it is also
                    considered a part of western Europe. The country covers a total area of 301,340 km2 (116,350 sq mi)
                    and shares land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, and the enclaved microstates
                    of Vatican City and San Marino. Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland (Campione) and a
                    maritime exclave in the Tunisian Sea (Lampedusa). With around 60 million inhabitants, Italy is
                    the fourth-most populous member state of the European Union.
                    <br><br>
                    Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean, Italy has
                    historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures. In addition to the various ancient
                    peoples dispersed throughout modern-day Italy, the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic
                    peoples who gave the peninsula its name, beginning from
                    the classical era, Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular
                    Italy,[20] Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy,
                    while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively. An Italic tribe known
                    as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC, which eventually became
                    a republic with a government of the Senate and the People. The Roman Republic
                    initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the peninsula, eventually expanding and
                    conquering parts of Europe, North Africa and Asia. By the first century BC, the Roman Empire emerged
                    as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural, political and
                    religious centre, inaugurating the Pax Romana, a period of more than 200 years during which
                    Italy's law, technology, economy, art, and literature developed. Italy remained the homeland of the
                    Romans and the metropole of the empire, whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution
                    of culture, governments, Christianity and the Latin script.

                During the Early Middle Ages, Italy endured sociopolitical collapse and barbarian invasions, but by
                the 11th century, numerous rival city-states and maritime republics, mainly in the northern and
                central regions of Italy, rose to great prosperity through trade, commerce and banking, laying the
                groundwork for modern capitalism. These mostly independent statelets served as Europe's main trading
                hubs with Asia and the Near East, often enjoying a greater degree of democracy than the
                larger feudal monarchies that were consolidating throughout Europe; however, part of central Italy
                was under the control of the theocratic Papal States, while Southern Italy remained largely feudal
                until the 19th century, partially as a result of a succession
                of Byzantine, Arab, Norman, Angevin, Aragonese and other foreign conquests of the
                region.[24] The Renaissance began in Italy and spread to the rest of Europe, bringing a renewed
                interest in humanism, science, exploration and art. Italian culture flourished, producing famous
                scholars, artists and polymaths. During the Middle Ages, Italian explorers discovered new routes to
                the Far East and the New World, helping to usher in the European Age of Discovery. Nevertheless,
                Italy's commercial and political power significantly waned with the opening of trade routes that
                bypassed the Mediterranean.[25] Furthermore, centuries of infighting between the Italian
                city-states, such as the Italian Wars of the 15th and 16th centuries, left the region fragmented,
                and it was subsequently conquered, exploited, and further divided by European powers such
                as France, Spain and Austria.

            <div> By the mid-19th century, rising Italian nationalism and calls for independence from foreign control
                led to a period of revolutionary political upheaval. After centuries of foreign domination and
                political division, Italy was almost entirely unified in 1861, establishing the Kingdom of Italy as
                a great power.[26] From the late 19th century to the early 20th century, Italy rapidly
                industrialised, namely in the north, and acquired a colonial empire, while the south remained
                largely impoverished and excluded from industrialisation, fuelling a large and
                influential diaspora.[28] Despite being one of the main victors in World War I, Italy entered a
                period of economic crisis and social turmoil, leading to the rise of a fascist dictatorship in 1922.
                Participation in World War II on the Axis side ended in military defeat, economic destruction and
                the Italian Civil War. Following the liberation of Italy and the rise of the resistance, the country
                abolished the monarchy, established a democratic Republic, and enjoyed a prolonged economic boom,
                becoming a highly developed country.
                Today, Italy is considered to be one of the world's most culturally and economically advanced
                countries, with its economy ranking eighth-largest in the world and third in the Eurozone by nominal
                GDP. Italy has the sixth-largest worldwide national wealth, the third-largest central bank gold
                reserve, and a very high life expectancy. The country plays a prominent role in regional and global
                economic, military, cultural and diplomatic affairs; it is both a regional power and a great
                power, and is ranked the world's eighth most-powerful military. Italy is
                a founding and leading member of the European Union and a member of numerous international
                institutions, including the UN, NATO, the OECD, the OSCE, the WTO, the G7, the G20, the Union for
                the Mediterranean, the Council of Europe, Uniting for Consensus, the Schengen Area and many more.
                The country have greatly influenced and contributed to diverse fields, notably
                the arts, music, literature, philosophy, science and technology, fashion, cinema, cuisine, sports,
                as well as jurisprudence, banking and business. As a reflection of its cultural wealth, Italy is
                home to the world's largest number of World Heritage Sites, and is the fifth-most visited country.

                <h4><b>Art</b></h4>
                <p>The history of Italian visual art is one of the most important parts of Western painting history.
                    Roman art was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek
                    painting. However, Roman painting does have important unique characteristics. The only surviving
                    Roman paintings are wall paintings, many from villas in Campania, in Southern Italy. Such painting
                    can be grouped into four main "styles" or periods and may contain the first examples of
                    trompe-l'œil, pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape.
                    <br><br>
                    Panel painting becomes more common during the Romanesque period, under the heavy influence of
                    Byzantine icons. Towards the middle of the 13th century, Medieval art and Gothic painting became
                    more realistic, with the beginnings of interest in the depiction of volume and perspective in Italy
                    with Cimabue and then his pupil Giotto. From Giotto on, the treatment of composition by the best
                    painters also became much more free and innovative. They are considered to be the two great medieval
                    masters of painting in western culture.</p>

                <p>Italian Renaissance is said by many to be the golden age of painting; roughly spanning the 14th
                    through the mid-17th centuries with a significant influence also out of the borders of modern Italy.
                    In Italy artists like Paolo Uccello, Fra Angelico, Masaccio, Piero della Francesca, Andrea Mantegna,
                    Filippo Lippi, Giorgione, Tintoretto, Sandro Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo Buonarroti,
                    Raphael, Giovanni Bellini, and Titian took painting to a higher level through the use of
                    perspective, the study of human anatomy and proportion, and through their development of an
                    unprecedented refinement in drawing and painting techniques. Michelangelo was an active sculptor
                    from about 1500 to 1520, and his great masterpieces including his David, Pietà, Moses. Other
                    prominent Renaissance sculptors include Lorenzo Ghiberti, Luca Della Robbia, Donatello, Filippo
                    Brunelleschi and Andrea del Verrocchio.</p>

            <div>
                In the 15th and 16th centuries, the High Renaissance gave rise to a stylised art known as Mannerism.
                In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterised art at
                the dawn of the 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The
                unperturbed faces and gestures of Piero della Francesca and the calm Virgins of Raphael are replaced
                by the troubled expressions of Pontormo and the emotional intensity of El Greco.</p>
                <p>In the 17th century, among the greatest painters of Italian Baroque are Caravaggio, Annibale
                    Carracci, Artemisia Gentileschi, Mattia Preti, Carlo Saraceni and Bartolomeo Manfredi. Subsequently,
                    in the 18th century, Italian Rococo was mainly inspired by French Rococo, since France was the
                    founding nation of that particular style, with artists such as Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and
                    Canaletto. Italian Neoclassical sculpture focused, with Antonio Canova's nudes, on the idealist
                    aspect of the movement.</p>

                <p>In the 19th century, major Italian Romantic painters were Francesco Hayez, Giuseppe Bezzuoli and
                    Francesco Podesti. Impressionism was brought from France to Italy by the Macchiaioli, led by
                    Giovanni Fattori, and Giovanni Boldini; Realism by Gioacchino Toma and Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo.
                    In the 20th century, with Futurism, primarily through the works of Umberto Boccioni and Giacomo
                    Balla, Italy rose again as a seminal country for artistic evolution in painting and sculpture.
                    Futurism was succeeded by the metaphysical paintings of Giorgio de Chirico, who exerted a strong
                    influence on the Surrealists and generations of artists to follow like Bruno Caruso and Renato
                    Guttuso.</p>

                <h4><b>Italian Cuisine</b></h4>
                <p>
                    The Italian cuisine has developed through centuries of social and political changes, with roots as
                    far back as the 4th century BC. Italian cuisine in itself takes heavy influences,
                    including Etruscan, ancient Greek, ancient Roman, Byzantine, and Jewish. Significant changes
                    occurred with the discovery of the New World with the introduction of items such
                    as potatoes, tomatoes, bell peppers and maize, now central to the cuisine but not introduced in
                    quantity until the 18th century. Italian cuisine is noted for its regional diversity, abundance of
                    difference in taste, and is known to be one of the most popular in the world, wielding strong
                    influence abroad.</p>

            <div>
                <p>The Mediterranean diet forms the basis of Italian cuisine, rich in pasta, fish, fruits and
                    vegetables and characterised by its extreme simplicity and variety, with many dishes having only
                    four to eight ingredients. Italian cooks rely chiefly on the quality of the ingredients rather than
                    on elaborate preparation. Dishes and recipes are often derivatives from local and familial tradition
                    rather than created by chefs, so many recipes are ideally suited for home cooking, this being one of
                    the main reasons behind the ever-increasing worldwide popularity of Italian cuisine, from America to
                    Asia. Ingredients and dishes vary widely by region.</p>

            <br><br>
            <div>
                <p>A key factor in the success of Italian cuisine is its heavy reliance on traditional products; Italy
                    has the most traditional specialities protected under EU law. Cheese, cold cuts and wine are a major
                    part of Italian cuisine, with many regional declinations and Protected Designation of
                    Origin or Protected Geographical Indication labels, and along with coffee (especially espresso) make
                    up a very important part of the Italian gastronomic culture. Desserts have a long tradition of
                    merging local flavours such as citrus fruits, pistachio and almonds with sweet cheeses
                    like mascarpone and ricotta or exotic tastes as cocoa, vanilla and
                    cinnamon. Gelato, tiramisù and cassata are among the most famous examples of Italian desserts, cakes
                    and patisserie.
